# nf_prom

A NetFlow(ish) to Prometheus.io exporter that tracks the number of bytes sent and received by local (RFC1918) IPv4 hosts.
It is intended to be used to monitor usage on a network that uses a pfSense firewall and has only been tested in that
environment.

Currently only NetFlow v9 generated by collectd is properly supported.
